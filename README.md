This project, encapsulated in the Final_Project.py script, utilizes Census income data to train and test various machine learning models. The script employs visualizations to interpret raw data and assess model performance comprehensively.

Data Files:
The project uses two primary data files:

census-income.data.csv - This file serves as the training dataset.
census-income.test.csv - This file is used as the testing dataset.
Both files must be present in the project directory for the script to function correctly.

Usage Instructions:
Setup: Ensure that Python 3 and necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) are installed on your system.
Data Files: Place the census-income.data.csv and census-income.test.csv files in the same directory as Final_Project.py.
Configuration: Verify that the file paths in Final_Project.py are correctly set to point to the locations of your data files.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, imputing missing values, balancing data, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training and Evaluation: Implements various models to predict income levels.
Visualization: Generates plots and graphs to provide insights into the data distribution and model accuracy.
